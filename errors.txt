Read the start-dbaMigration in the attachment.
I want to amend it so that:
For All object types, give the option to select a list of these objetc instead of moving all.
No regression is allowed.
All : If the object type param is omitted, take all objects of that type
nothing: put it in the exclude list
Custom: copy a comma separated list of objects
